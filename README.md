Kubernetes Bible
================

The Kubernetes Bible contains resources, books, tutorials, tools, installers, utilities, applications, and more. Everything you need to learn Kubernetes and find useful resources in developing on Kubernetes clusters.

### Inspiration
This Bible was inspired by [awesome-docker](https://github.com/veggiemonk/awesome-docker) and [awesome-kubernetes](https://github.com/ramitsurana/awesome-kubernetes). However, this Bible aims to be more than a curated list of resources for Kubernetes.
